    "## Optimizing model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Nengo uses the [Neural Engineering\n",
    "Framework](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html) to optimize the parameters\n",

    "Which techniques work best will depend on the particular model being developed.\n",
    "However, as a general rule of thumb the deep learning methods will tend to take longer\n",
    "but provide more accurate network output.  One reason for this is that deep learning\n",
    "methods can jointly optimize across all the parameters in the network (e.g., adjusting\n",
    "the decoders for multiple chained connections so that they work together to compute a\n",
    "function), whereas the NEF optimization is applied to each connection individually.\n",
    "Deep learning methods can also optimize all the parameters in a network (encoders,\n",
    "decoders, and biases), whereas NEF methods are only applied to decoders.  We'll\n",
    "illustrate this difference in this example by using a hybrid approach, where we use the\n",
    "NEF to compute the decoders and deep learning methods to optimize encoders and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we're going to make some changes to the model itself.  We created the model with\n",
    "the default synaptic filter of `nengo.Lowpass(tau=0.005)` on all the Connections.  This\n",
    "makes sense when we're working with a spiking model, as the filters reduce the spike\n",
    "noise in the communication between Ensembles.  However, when we're training a network in\n",

    "may be something we care about and want to optimize for.  But in this instance we don't\n",
    "particularly care about the synaptic dynamics.  During training NengoDL will\n",
    "automatically be swapping the spiking `nengo.LIF` neuron model for the non-spiking\n",
