    "# Optimizing spiking neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all deep learning methods are based on [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), which means that the network being optimized needs to be differentiable.  Deep neural networks are usually built using rectified linear or sigmoid neurons, as these are differentiable nonlinearities.  However, in biological neural modelling we often want to use spiking neurons, which are not differentiable.  So the challenge is how to apply deep learning methods to spiking neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method for accomplishing this is presented in [Hunsberger and Eliasmith (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08829).  The idea is to use a differentiable approximation of the spiking neurons during the training process, which can then be swapped for spiking neurons once the optimization is complete.  In this example we will use these techniques to develop a network to classify handwritten digits ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) in a spiking convolutional network.  "

The parameters of `nengo_dl.SoftLIFRate` are the same as LIF/LIFRate, with the addition of the `sigma` parameter which controls the smoothness of the approximation (the lower the value of `sigma`, the closer `SoftLIFRate` approximates the true LIF/LIFRate firing curves.\n",

To make things even easier, we'll use `nengo_dl.tensor_layer`.  This is a utility function for constructing `TensorNodes` that mimics the layer-based syntax of many deep learning packages (e.g. [tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers)).  The full documentation for this function can be found [here](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/tensor_node.html).  \n",

So when we build a `tensor_layer` we pass it the input to the layer, the transformation we want to apply (expressed as a function that accepts a `tf.Tensor` as input and produces a `tf.Tensor` as output), and any arguments to that transformation function.  `tensor_layer` also has optional `transform` and `synapse` parameters that set those respective values on the Connection from the previous layer to the one being constructed.\n",
