    "## NEF parameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "NengoDL also provides access to a different optimization method, the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF).  This uses linear least-squares optimization to solve for optimal connection weights analytically, rather than using an iterative gradient-descent based algorithm.  The advantage of the NEF is that it is very fast and general (for example, it does not require the network to be differentiable).  The disadvantage is that it optimizes each set of connection weights individually (i.e., it cannot jointly optimize across multiple layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEF optimization is accessed by setting the `function` argument on a `nengo.Connection`.  This specifies the function that we would like those connection weights to approximate.  In addition, in previous examples you may have noticed that we were forming Connections using `ensemble.neurons` (rather than `ensemble`).  Using `ensemble.neurons` specifies that we want to form a direct connection between ensemble neurons, without applying the NEF optimization.  So when we want to use the `function` argument, the `Connection` source object should be an `ensemble`, not `ensemble.neurons`.  For example, we could use the NEF to create a network to approximate the function $sin(x^2)$:"

We have also discussed how to use TensorNodes to combine TensorFlow and Nengo code, and introduced some of the unique features of Nengo (such as NEF optimization and neuromorphic cross-platform execution).  However, there is much more functionality in NengoDL than we are able to introduce here; check out the [user guide](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/user-guide.html) or [other examples](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/examples.html) for more information.
