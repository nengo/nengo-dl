Release History
===============

.. Changelog entries should follow this format:

   version (release date)
   ----------------------

   **section**

   - One-line description of change (link to Github issue/PR)

.. Changes should be organized in one of several sections:

   - Added
   - Changed
   - Deprecated
   - Removed
   - Fixed

0.3.1 (unreleased)
------------------

**Added**

- Added more documentation on Simulator arguments
- Improved efficiency of tree_planner, made it the new default planner

**Fixed**

- Correctly handle input feeds when n_steps > step_blocks
- Detect cycles in transitive planner
- Fix bug in uneven step_blocks rounding
- Fix bug in Simulator.print_params
- Fix bug related to merging of learning rule with different dimensionality


0.3.0 (April 25, 2017)
----------------------

**Added**

- Use logger for debug/builder output
- Implemented TensorFlow gradients for sparse Variable update Ops, to allow
  models with those elements to be trained
- Added tutorial/examples on using ``Simulator.train``
- Added support for training models when ``unroll_simulation=False``
- Compatibility changes for Nengo 2.4.0
- Added a new graph planner algorithm, which can improve simulation speed at
  the cost of build time

**Changed**

- Significant improvements to simulation speed

  - Use sparse Variable updates for signals.scatter/gather
  - Improved graph optimizer memory organization
  - Implemented sparse matrix multiplication op, to allow more aggressive
    merging of DotInc operators

- Significant improvements to build speed

  - Added early termination to graph optimization
  - Algorithmic improvements to graph optimization functions

- Reorganized documentation to more clearly direct new users to relevant
  material

**Fixed**

- Fix bug where passing a built model to the Simulator more than once would
  result in an error
- Cache result of calls to ``tensor_graph.build_loss/build_optimizer``, so that
  we don't unnecessarily create duplicate elements in the graph on repeated
  calls
- Fix support for Variables on GPU when ``unroll_simulation=False``
- SimPyFunc operators will always be assigned to CPU, even when
  ``device="/gpu:0"``, since there is no GPU kernel
- Fix bug where ``Simulator.loss`` was not being computed correctly for
  models with internal state
- Data/targets passed to ``Simulator.train`` will be truncated if not evenly
  divisible by the specified minibatch size
- Fixed bug where in some cases Nodes with side effects would not be run if
  their output was not used in the simulation
- Fixed bug where strided reads that cover a full array would be interpreted as
  non-strided reads of the full array


0.2.0 (March 13, 2017)
----------------------

Initial release of TensorFlow-based NengoDL


0.1.0 (June 12, 2016)
---------------------

Initial release of Lasagne-based NengoDL
