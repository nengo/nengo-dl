    "# Optimizing spiking neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all deep learning methods are based on [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), which means that the network being optimized needs to be differentiable.  Deep neural networks are usually built using rectified linear or sigmoid neurons, as these are differentiable nonlinearities.  However, in biological neural modelling we often want to use spiking neurons, which are not differentiable.  So the challenge is how to apply deep learning methods to spiking neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method for accomplishing this is presented in [Hunsberger and Eliasmith (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05141).  The basic idea is to use a differentiable approximation of the spiking neurons during the training process, and the actual spiking neurons during inference.  NengoDL will perform these transformations automatically if the user tries to optimize a model containing a spiking neuron model that has an equivalent, differentiable rate-based implementation.  In this example we will use these techniques to develop a network to classify handwritten digits ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) in a spiking convolutional network.  "

    "We will use [TensorNodes](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/tensor_node.html) to construct the network, as they allow us to easily include features such as convolutional connections.  To make things even easier, we'll use `nengo_dl.tensor_layer`.  This is a utility function for constructing `TensorNodes` that mimics the layer-based syntax of many deep learning packages (e.g. [tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers)).  The full documentation for this function can be found [here](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/tensor_node.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "`tensor_layer` is used to build a sequence of layers, where each layer takes the output of the previous layer and applies some transformation to it.  So when we build a `tensor_layer` we pass it the input to the layer, the transformation we want to apply (expressed as a function that accepts a `tf.Tensor` as input and produces a `tf.Tensor` as output), and any arguments to that transformation function.  `tensor_layer` also has optional `transform` and `synapse` parameters that set those respective values on the Connection from the previous layer to the one being constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally all signals in a Nengo model are (batched) vectors.  However, certain layer functions, such as convolutional layers, may expect a different shape for their inputs.  If the `shape_in` argument is specified for a `tensor_layer` then the inputs to\n",
    "the layer will automatically be reshaped to the given shape.  Note that this shape does not include the batch dimension on the first axis, as that will be automatically set by the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tensor_layer` can also be passed a Nengo NeuronType, instead of a Tensor function.  In this case `tensor_layer` will construct an Ensemble implementing the given neuron nonlinearity (the rest of the arguments work the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `tensor_layer` is just a syntactic wrapper for constructing `TensorNodes` or `Ensembles`; anything we build with a `tensor_layer` we could instead construct directly using those underlying components.  `tensor_layer` just simplifies the construction of this common layer-based pattern."
