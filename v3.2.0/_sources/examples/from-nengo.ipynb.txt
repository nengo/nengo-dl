    "\n",
    "By default, Nengo uses the [Neural Engineering Framework](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/nef.html) to optimize the parameters of a model.  NengoDL adds a new set of optimization tools (deep learning training methods) to that toolkit, which can be used instead of or in addition to the NEF optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which techniques work best will depend on the particular model being developed.  However, as a general rule of thumb the deep learning methods will tend to take longer but provide more accurate network output.  One reason for this is that deep learning methods can jointly optimize across all the parameters in the network (e.g., adjusting the decoders for multiple chained connections so that they work together to compute a function), whereas the NEF optimization is applied to each connection individually.  Deep learning methods can also optimize all the parameters in a network (encoders, decoders, and biases), whereas NEF methods are only applied to decoders.  We'll illustrate this difference in this example by using a hybrid approach, where we use the NEF to compute the decoders and deep learning methods to optimize encoders and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we're going to make some changes to the model itself.  We created the model with the default synaptic filter of `nengo.Lowpass(tau=0.005)` on all the Connections.  This makes sense when we're working with a spiking model, as the filters reduce the spike noise in the communication between Ensembles.  However, when we're training a network in NengoDL the synaptic filters introduce more complex temporal dynamics into the optimization problem.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as those temporal dynamics may be something we care about and want to optimize for.  But in this instance we don't particularly care about the synaptic dynamics.  During training NengoDL will automatically be swapping the spiking `nengo.LIF` neuron model for the non-spiking `nengo.LIFRate`, so we don't need the synaptic filters to reduce spike noise.  And because this is a simple feedforward network, there aren't any other temporal dynamics in the system that the synaptic filtering would interact with.  So we can simplify our optimization problem by removing the synaptic filters, without significantly changing the behaviour of our model."

This is much the same as the `data` argument introduced above, and the arrays have a similar shape `(batch_size, n_steps, node/probe_size)`.

That is, training with a batch size of 1 for 1000 timesteps is the same as training with a batch size of 1000 for 1 timestep.  And the latter is preferred, as the computations will be more efficient when we can divide them into minibatches and parallelize them.\n",

    "Another important feature of NengoDL is the ability to add TensorFlow code into a Nengo model.  For example, we could use a convolutional vision network, defined in TensorFlow, as the input to a cognitive Nengo model.  However, we'll keep things simple in this example and just use TensorFlow to compute the exponent of our output (so that overall the network is computing $e^{\\sin(x^2)}$).  Note that for something like this we don't really need to use TensorFlow; we can accomplish the same thing with normal Nengo syntax.  The goal here is just to introduce the methodology in a simple case; see [this example](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/examples/pretrained-model.html) for a more practical example of integrating TensorFlow code in NengoDL.\n",

    "In this tutorial we have introduced the NengoDL Simulator, batch processing, dynamically specifying input values, optimizing model parameters using deep learning methods, and integrating TensorFlow code into a Nengo model.  This will allow you to begin to take advantage of the new features NengoDL adds to the Nengo toolkit.  However, there is much more functionality in NengoDL than we are able to introduce here; check out the [user guide](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/user-guide.html) or [other examples](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-dl/examples.html) for more information."
