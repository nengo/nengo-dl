Examples
========

These examples can be found in the ``<nengo-dl>/docs/examples`` directory
(where ``<nengo-dl>`` is the location of the NengoDL package).  The examples
are IPython/Jupyter notebooks; if you would like to run them yourself, refer to
the
`Jupyter documentation <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

We recommend starting with the two introductory tutorials.  One is designed for
Nengo users who want to learn about NengoDL, and the other for TensorFlow
users.  If you are not familiar with Nengo or TensorFlow, we would recommend
beginning with the standard
`Nengo documentation <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo>`_, and then
come back here!
